You must add "host: "0.0.0.0" in the Vite config so that the address of the
Docker container and the Vite application does not conflict. This is because
Docker is like its own OS whether you are running in on Windows, WSL, or MAC.
You may see online that people used "host: true" as well as other commands but
this did not work for me.

You may notice that the mongo service quite frequently outputs logs in Docker.
A potential workaround is to create a mongod.conf file with verbosity: 0
locally and then create another Dockerfile, for the database, to mount on the
docker-compose. However, I do not know if this works as I did not try but
supposely found from the official documentation. On the other hand, you can
just use Docker Desktop as it automatically separates logs between each runnin
service. This can be accomplished by building the docker-compose file in the
terminal first and then running it on Docker Desktop.

You may notice that you cannot stop the running docker instance while being in
the terminal. To fix this, open a new terminal instance to input docker
commands, start docker containers in internative mode, or use Docker Desktop.

Please note that he node version imported for Docker is important as older
verisons may not support React Router v7 and/or Vite applications.

For this template, I will not be using .venv along with Docker.

If your Docker container is not behaving properly or you made numerous builds,
then run docker system prune --all --volumes to free up storage and to reset
images.
